title: "NGINX Config: http to https"

<p>
	I’ve recently installed a self-signed certificate on my server just for the login areas for my own peace of mind. After having a rough time trying to handle the redirection from Rack itself, I opted to do this through NGINX, which turned out to be quite a bit easier. Below is a snippet of the virtual host I used:

{% highlight bash %}
server {
            listen   80;
            server_name happygastropod.com;
            rewrite ^/admin https://happygastropod.com/admin permanent;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	It’s pretty self explanatory. Takes a regular expression of the path you’d like to redirect, and simply redirect it off to the https alternative. Enjoy.
