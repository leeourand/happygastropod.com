	When solving linear algebraic systems, it is often beneficial to use iterative methods. Iterative solvers are particularly useful when a matrix is diagonally dominant. One such iterative method that is particularly useful is Jacobi Iteration.
</p>

<p>
	Given a matrix <em>A</em>, you first decompose it into 3 separate matrices: <em>L</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>U</em>. These are the <em>lower</em>, <em>diagonal</em>, and <em>upper</em> sections of the matrix, respectively.<br />

</p> 

<p>
	For example, let&#8217;s assume we&#8217;ve been given this matrix A:<br /> 
<img class="math" src="/assets/jacobi_a_matrix.gif" alt="Example Matrix" />
</p> 

<p>
	We will then zero-out everything above and including the diagonal entries. This will give us our new L matrix.<br /> 
<img class="math" src="/assets/jacobi_l_matrix.gif" alt="Example L Matrix" />
</p> 

<p>Likewise, we&#8217;ll remove all entries below, and including the diagonal from matrix A to give us our matrix U. <br /> 
<img class="math" src="/assets/jacobi_u_matrix.gif" alt="Example U Matrix" />
</p>

<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll zero-out all non-diagonal entries, to yield our new matrix D.<br /> 
<img class="math" src="/assets/jacobi_d_matrix.gif" alt="Example D Matrix" />
</p> 

<p>
	As stated previously, since <em>A=L+D+U</em>, we can deduce that <em>Ax=Dx+(L+U)x</em>. And since <em>Ax=b</em>, we can conclude that <em>Dx=b-(L+U)x</em>, which is the basis of Jacobi&#8217;s Method.
</p> 

<p>
	Given an estimate vector (x) (which is generally initialized to 0 if no educated guess can be provided), the next estimate is found by:<br /> 
<img class="math" src="/assets/jacobi_basis.gif" alt="Basic Jacobi Form" />
</p> 

<p>
	And since <em>D</em> is a diagonal matrix, the above equation can be rewritten in terms of the components of <em>A</em> and <em>b</em>.<br />

<br style="clear: both;" /> 
So now that we understand how Jacobi Iteration works, we can write a program to do it for us! Ruby is not necessarily the best language to do this in, as these systems can often times be quite large. Compiled languages such as C++ are going to converge much faster.</p> 
<p>To start out, we&#8217;re going to write a method that takes in our Matrix <em>A</em>, our right hand size <em>b</em>, the number of times we&#8217;d like to iterate, and our initial guess.
</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>def jacobi_iteration(A, b, iterations, guess |= 0)</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>
	From here, we will need to fire up our estimate vector <em>x</em>. We&#8217;ll initialize its first element to be the initial &#8220;guess,&#8221; and the remaining entries to be 0.
</p> 

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'># Initialize
  x = Array.new(A.size)
  x[0] = guess
  1.upto(A.size) do |i|
    x[i] = 0
  end</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>
	Finally, we implement the equation above as nested loops to iteratively try to converge to a solution.
</p> 

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>0.upto(iterations-1) do |its|
    0.upto(A.size) do |i|
      sum = 0
      0.upto(A.size) do |j|
        unless j==i
          sum = A[i][j] * x[j]
        end
      end
      x[i] = 1.0/A[i][i] * (b[i] - sum)
    end
  end
end</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>And there you have it! If you're doing this on large matrices, I would definitely suggest using a different language, such as C++ to handle this, since Ruby can not only be a bit slower, but it's also quite a memory hog when dealing with so many objects.</p>
