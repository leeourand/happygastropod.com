<h3>This Site</h3> 
<p>HappyGastropod is the digital playground of Lee Ourand (aka me). Here you will find some of my projects, ramblings, or whatever other nonsense I should decide to put on here.</p> 
<p>For you geeks out there, this site is hosted at the very awesome <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> where I have a 512M VPS. It's powered by a small Ruby back-end running on the speed demon that is NGINX. The site is written using Jekyll, so everything should be quite snappy!</p> 
<h3>Lee</h3> 
<p><img src="/resources/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait of Lee" />Hi there! My name is Lee. I'm a recent graduate from <a href="http://odu.edu">Old Dominion University</a>, where I studied Computer Science. I'm an avid  2-wheel enthusiast (bicycles and motorcycles). I've ridden and raced Motocross since the young age of 6, and have been hooked ever since. I began riding on the street as soon as I could afford it, to make up for my diminishing time on the MX track. My motocross sled is a 2005 YZ250F and my street bike is a 2005 CBR600F4i. I have a Mercier Kilo TT bicycle that I ride anywhere in my neighborhood of Ghent, Norfolk. Aside from that, I enjoy talking to new people. So hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/the_gastropod">twitter</a>.</p>
