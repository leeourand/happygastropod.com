title: About The Gastropod

<h3>This Site</h3> 
<p>HappyGastropod is the digital playground of Lee Ourand (aka me). Here you will find some of my projects, ramblings, or whatever other nonsense I should decide to put on here.</p> 
<p>For you geeks out there, this site is hosted at the very awesome <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> where I have a 512M VPS. It's powered by a small Ruby back-end running on the speed demon that is NGINX. The site is written using Jekyll, so everything should be quite snappy!</p> 
<h3>Lee</h3> 
<p><img src="/resources/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait of Lee" />Well, first, I'm obviously the guy responsible for this silliness. I'm a Computer Science student studying at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. I will be graduating this semester (May 2011). I am interested in most of the field of Computer Science, particularly the theoretical, and mathematical sides of things, these days.</p>
<p>I'm an avid motorcyclist. I've ridden and raced Motocross since the young age of 6, and have been hooked ever since. I began riding on the street as soon as I could afford it, to make up for my diminishing time on the MX track. My motocross sled is a 2005 YZ250F and my street bike is a 2005 CBR600F4i. I have no aspirations of being professional or even all that good. But I enjoy riding too much to be discouraged by that!</p>
