###This Site### 

HappyGastropod is the digital homestead of Mr. Lee Ourand. Here you will find some of his projects, ideas, complaints, or general buffoonery. 

For you geeks out there, the site is hosted on a [Linode](http://linode.com) VPS. It's powered by a small Ruby back-end running on the always classy NGINX.

###Lee Ourand### 

![Portrait of Lee](/resources/portrait.jpg)Mr. Lee Ourand is the man that can be held responsible for this silliness. He's a Computer Science student studying at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. He will be graduating this semester (May 2011). He currently works as a System Administrator for [InMotion Hosting](http://inmotionhosting.com), a small-ish California-Based web hosting company.

Lee is an avid motorcyclist, having ridden and raced Motocross since the young age of 6. He began riding on the street as soon as the insurance became affordable, in order to make up for his diminishing time on the MX track. His motocross sled is a 2005 YZ250F and the street bike is a 2005 CBR600F4i. He has no aspirations of being professional or even all that good, which is a handy excuse to use when you suck.

Interestingly, he finds it almost as odd as you do that he wrote this page in the 3rd person. If that didn't frighten you off, and you'd like to chit-chat, you can find him on [twitter](http://twitter.com/the_gastropod)---or you could always send him a good old fashioned <a href="mailto:&#108;&#101;&#101;&#64;&#104;&#97;&#112;&#112;&#121;&#103;&#97;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#111;&#112;&#111;&#100;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">e-mail</a>.
