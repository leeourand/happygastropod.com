<h3>This Site</h3>
<p>HappyGastropod is the digital playground of Lee Ourand (aka me). Here you will find some of my projects, ramblings, or whatever other nonsense I should decide to put on here.</p>
<p>For you geeks out there, this site is hosted at the very awesome <a href="http://slicehost.com">slicehost</a> where I have a 256MB slice that I'm pretty satisfied with. It's powered by a small Ruby back-end running on the speed demon that is NGINX.</p>

<p><img src="images/photos/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait of Lee" />Well, first, I'm obviously the guy responsible for this silliness. I'm a Computer Science student studying at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. I am interested in most of the field of Computer Science, but I really don&rsquo;t like C++. Go figure.</p>
<p>I'm also an avid motorcyclist. I've ridden and raced Motocross since the young age of 6, and have been hooked ever since. I recently started riding on the street as well. My motocross sled is a 2005 YZ250F and my street bike is an (old) 1993 CBR600F2. I have no aspirations of being professional or even very good. But I enjoy riding too much to be discouraged by that!</p>
